# Warning
Ajax calls need services like Firebase or the sentaku api that are note provided by me. This repo is just for people who need an example in reason react.

# State of the project
This repository is an unfinished school project. Why unfinished ? Because we had some problems with https and didn't manage to correct them in time, so this is the project in its last state.
